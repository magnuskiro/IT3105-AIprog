1a: Best threshold found when incrementing 0.001 per iteration. 
	Also tried with 0.0001, but no change in match. 
	Optimal threshold value is 0.8240, which gives an accuracy of 0.5150

1b: Best threshold for LEMMAS found when incrementing 0.001 per iteration,
	0.0001 gave no improvement. Optimal threshold value is 0.91, which 
	gives an accuracy of 0.5100. Why does this give lower accuracy than
	comparing words? Note that in the preprocessed data, words like "Italy's"
	are considered to be two words! "Italy" being one lemma, and "'s" another.
	Also, punctuation, like "." and "," are also treated as lemmas. Do we
	need to take this into account?
	
	Best threshold for POS-TAG found when incrementing 0.001 per iteration,
	0.00001 gave no improvement. Optimal threshold value is 0.9, which 
	gives an accuracy of 0.5262
