% prepeares the data and creates the datastructure we use in the rest of the system. 
    % calculates some variables first
    % runs a loop to find peaks in graph. We use the peaks to compare later. 
    
% signal is the wav file, Fs is the sampling rate
function [pData] = data(signal, Fs)

% normalize the signal so that the values fall between -1 & 1

% go through all frames, find the peaks and sort them in descending order
% the five largest peaks, and their locations, will be used to identify the sound
% the following creates a 3-dimensional array, imagine it like a stack of paper, 
% peaks and locations in a frame on one sheet, the next frame on the next sheet etc.
