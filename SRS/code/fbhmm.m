% contains the forward and backward hmm. and a function to calculate probability. 
    % forward hmm, used to update the hmm, and used for identification of the sound. sums up the probabilities og calcProb.
    % backward hmm, used for identification of the sound. 
    % calcProb, calculates a partial probability of sound likelihood.
