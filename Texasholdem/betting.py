#5. after the flop, players evaluate the power of their hands; weak(1-3), mediocre(4-6), strong(7-9)
#6. weak players fold, call or check at random (perhaps with a weighted randomness, players with a hand of strengt 1 fold more often than 3?)
#7. mediocre players call or raise at random (again, with weighted randomness?)
