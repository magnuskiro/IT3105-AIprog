Get to know cards.py
Basic Poker simulation:

 - Preliminaries
	- limit the number of raises in a round
	- set a betting limit
	- allow players to go into debt
	[x]- set an initial amount of money for each player

 - The game
	[x]1. choose number of players
	[x]2. deal cards
	3. the game starts with small blind and big blind
	4. all players stay in the game until the flop, calling or raising at random
	5. after the flop, players evaluate the power of their hands; weak(1-3), mediocre(4-6), strong(7-9)
	6. weak players fold, call or check at random (perhaps with a weighted randomness, players with a hand of strengt 1 fold more often than 3?)
	7. mediocre players call or raise at random (again, with weighted randomness?)
	8. strong players call or raise at random, with a better chance of raising than calling
	9. repeat steps 5-8 after the turn and river
	10. if all players except one, has folded, the remaining player wins the pot
	11. if not, then the player with the best hand wins
	12. if two or more players have equal hands, the pot is split between them



Phase II
A pre-op rollout simulator used to generate the winning potential of all hole-card pairs, and a pro-
cedure for calculating the hand-strength of the combination of hole cards and community cards. 45
points.


Phase III
An opponent modeler that a) records associations between game situations, opponent actions and the
